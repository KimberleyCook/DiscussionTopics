> Imara aims to draw a bridge between the worlds of design and computer science. Armed with a Product Design bachelor and a masters in Embedded Systems at the Delft University of Technology, she designs and develops smart interactive products that people love to use. Springlab realizes these products to encourage people to be both physically active and healthy. By formerly teaching electronics and programming to design students and now leading by example she hopes to bring both worlds closer together.
