> In 2013, Zara graduated from the University of Exeter with a degree in English and no idea whatsoever that she would end up working in tech. Since then, she has played a fundamental role in Aviva’s digital transformation, organised several InsurTech hackathons, helped to set-up an insurance network on Meetup and has even launched her own marketing campaign for Aviva’s innovation activity involving 500 yellow boxes and several of London’s co-working spaces.
